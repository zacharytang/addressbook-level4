== Introduction

Welcome to UniFy !

UniFy is a command-line application which provides a convenient way to store students' contact information. It is customised for NUS students, allowing them to efficiently manage their contact lists. This developer guide provides information that helps you to get started as a UniFy contributor, and aids you even if you are an experienced contributor.
The developer guide consists of the following sections.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app will only work with later versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Please do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up UniFy in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open your console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp`
. Try out a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Doing configurations before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

Our UniFy project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, then `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance automatically as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

You would have to set up `Travis` to perform CI for your fork. You can check <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up `AppVeyor` as a second CI (check <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both `Travis` and `AppVeyor` ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you can get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.


== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. A quick overview of each component is given below.

[TIP]
You can find the `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this developer guide in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

==== Main
`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

==== Commons
link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. These classes can be found in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package. The following two classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events.
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

==== Four main components
The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The User Interface (UI) of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The execution of command.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : The storage of the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : The saving and retrieving of data from the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (_Fig 3.1.2_) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This shows you how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

---
The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, and `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Command mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is designed to suit the needs of students who might accidentally execute a undesired command. It is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. You will be able to see the inheritance diagram for commands below (_Fig 4.1.1_).

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. The technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

When the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. You can find that he current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2a : The most recent undoable command is pushed into the undoStack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2b : More commands are added into the undoStack_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2c : The command on the top will be popped and pushed into the redoStack_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : The sequence diagram for the undo function_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2d : When a new command is pushed into undoStack, the redoStack is purged_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2e : The list command is not added to the undoStack_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

// tag::you[]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` is added. +
**Pros:** This does not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` will not know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** It would be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** An override `execute()` method is added. +
**Pros:** This does not involve the template pattern, so it is easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()` to gain the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** Execution of undo & redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The entire address book is saved. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** This may have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** This uses less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** Each individual command might be hard to implemented correctly.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`) is included. +
**Pros:** The view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost (We only revert changes that are hard to change back). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** All the commands are included. +
**Pros:** The view might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User has no way of skipping such commands if he or she just wants to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate stack for undo and redo are used. +
**Pros:** This is easy to understand for new Computer Science undergraduates, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** `HistoryManager` is used for undo/redo. +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** This would require dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::you[]
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetables Attribute
// tag::you[]
Users are able to store timetables by supplying a shortened NUSMods URL when adding a person. You will be able to understand how NUSMods URLs are being parsed and how the timetable information is being extracted. This need is especially crucial for NUS students who require friends' timetables in order to find out a time to meet up.
// end::you[]
==== Retrieval of Lesson Information

NUSMods URLs are in the format of `.../timetable/ACAD_YEAR/SEM?MODULE_CODE[LESSON_TYPE]=LESSON_NO&...`  We use `TimetableParserUtil:expandUrl()` to get an expanded URL from shortened URL provided, then parse the expanded URL accordingly to obtain lesson data.
Lessons for each module are stored in `ModuleInfoFromUrl`, which is then represented in `TimetableInfoFromUrl`.

https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods-api[NUSMods API] is used to retrieve data related to lessons parsed from URLs. JSON objects representing each module is retrieved and
cast to a `Map` using http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library]. Lesson data is then retrieved as a list of `Lesson` objects.

[source,java]
----
// read JSON as map
Map<String, Object> mappedJson = mapper.readValue(url, HashMap.class);
// retrieve lesson data
ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lessonInfo = mappedJson.get("Timetable");

ArrayList<Lesson> lessons = new ArrayList<>();
for (HashMap<String, String> lesson : lessonInfo) {
    Lesson lessonToAdd = new Lesson(...);
    lessons.add(lessonToAdd);
}
----

`TimetableParserUtil` in `commons.util.timetable` contains all utility methods for parsing of NUSMods URLs and conversion between terms parsed from URLs and terms used in NUSMods API.

==== Representation of Timetables

Storing of timetables is facilitated by an immutable `Timetable` object, which is a component of `Person`. The information regarding the timings of each lesson is stored in a single `TimetableInfo` object within `Timetable`.
More specific information for a person's lessons is abstracted further as follows:

* Information for odd/even weeks are stored by two `TimetableWeek` objects within `TimetableInfo`
* Each day of the timetable (Monday to Friday) is represented by five `TimetableDay` objects in `TimetableWeek`
* To represent each timeslot in `TimetableDay`, a `TimetableSlot` class is used to represent a 30 minute interval. 32 instances of `TimetableSlot` are used to represent a full day from 0800 to 0000

The following UML diagram represents the implementation of the classes.

image::TimetableClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.2.1 : Timetable class diagram (XYZComponent refers to all other components that `Person` is composed of, the class diagram is not complete)_

==== Displaying of Timetables

Displaying of timetables is facilitated using a single `TimetableDisplay` component, which resides above `BrowserPanel`. Both these
components are contained within `InfoPanel`, which handles specific events to bring either panel to the front.

Upon execution of a `whenfree` command, the following happens:

. `TimetableCommandParser` parses the input to determine which timetables to display.
.. If no arguments are passed, empty `ArrayList<Index>` is used.
.. Otherwise, arguments are parsed into their respective `Index` and stored in an `ArrayList<Index>`.
. A new `TimetableCommand` is constructed, using the list created by the parser.
. When `TimetableCommand:execute()` is called, the list of `Index`, is used to obtain the `ReadOnlyPerson` to display,
and stores it in a `List<ReadOnlyPerson>`.
. A `TimetableDisplayEvent` is then posted with the list of people to be displayed.
. The event is then handled by the `InfoPanel`, which creates a new `TimetableDisplay` component and brings it to the front.
.. Each `Timetable` to be displayed is obtained from the list of people from the `TimetableDisplayEvent` handled.
.. When `TimetableDisplay` component is created, `fillInitialGrid()` first populates the timetable with empty slots.
.. After which, each `Timetable` is added to the grid by `fillSingleTimetable()`.

Execution of a `select` command is similar, except that a `PersonSelectedEvent` is handled instead of a `TimetableDisplayEvent`

// tag::you[]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Representation of timetables +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Abstraction of timetable grid using classes for weeks/days/slots is used. +
**Pros:** This is easily extendable to include new functionality e.g. lessons that occur in each slot. +
**Cons:** This requires many method call chains to update and query timetable, might not be intuitive for new programmers. It is hard to iterate through entire timetable. +
**Alternative 2:** A 3D array to represent the entire timetable is used. +
**Pros:** It is simple and easy to understand,  easy to iterate through. +
**Cons:** This does not follow OOP concepts, and cannot be extended to implement new functionalities. +
**Alternative 3:** Individual lesson timings and information are stored. +
**Pros:** Building the timetable is not required. +
**Cons:** Queries are inefficient if a timing has a lesson, needs to iterate through every lesson stored.

---

**Aspect:** The use of Shortened URLs versus full-length URLs +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only short URLs are accepted. +
**Pros:** There is no need to deal with multiple types of URL. +
**Cons:** This is less user friendly as users need to supply specific type of URL. +
**Alternative 2:** Both shortened and full-length NUSMods URLs are accepted. +
**Pros:** This is more user friendly as any type of NUSMods URL is accepted. +
**Cons:** This is much harder to detect malformed URL as parsing data does not detect errors in lesson tokens in URL. Shortened URL gives 403 response on bad URL.

---

**Aspect:** Behaviour of app when there is no internet connection +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Only store timetable URLs, and query each time app is launched. If no internet, start with empty timetable. +
**Pros:** Storage needed is minimal, as only a single string is stored for each person. +
**Cons:** Startup of app can be slow if there is a large number of persons. +
**Alternative 2:** Store timetable information after retrieval from NUSMods once. +
**Pros:** We only need to retrieve lesson information once per person. +
**Cons:** Storage of entire timetables can be very costly, and storage can be expensive with a large number of contacts.
// end::you[]
// end::timetable[]

// tag::deletetag[]
=== Delete Command [Tag] Mechanism

Deleting a tag means deleting a specified tag in all persons who contain that tag, as well as deleting the tag from the master list of tags in the Address Book.
This is significantly different from deleting a tag for a person via the `edit` command.
There is a need for this because a user would like to delete a tag that is no longer relevant or is outdated.
To delete a particular tag across multiple contacts, by editing each contact, would be a tedious process, hence, the addition of this feature.

In this section, you will be able to understand how tags are deleted from all persons tagged with that tag, and how we use the same command word `delete`
to both delete one or more persons or delete one or more tags.

In general, the ability to delete a tag was implemented by modifying the existing `delete` command.

This modification involves:

* Detection of the type of deletion in the DeleteCommandParser
* Overloading the DeleteCommand constructor
* Executing the respective logic based on which attributes in `DeleteCommand` are present/non-null.

As a result of this modification, `delete` can execute a delete on tags, or a delete on persons, depending on the parameters provided.

==== Detection of the Deletion Type

For both types of `delete` commands, the same `delete` command word is used but the parameters provided in the command line are different.

The two types of commands are distinguished by the `preamble` of the parameter arguments after the word `delete`, when tokenized against the `t/` prefix for tags.

Preamble for

* `delete INDEX [MORE INDEXES]...` (Delete Person(s)) : A *digit* String
* `delete t/TAG [t/TAG]` (Delete Tag(s)) :  A *blank* String

The implementation of this parse is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public DeleteCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_TAG);
    String preamble = argMultimap.getPreamble();
    if (preamble.equals("")) {
        // there exists 't/'
        DeleteCommand deleteCommandForTag = parseForTags(argMultimap);
        if (deleteCommandForTag != null) {
            return deleteCommandForTag; <1>
        }
    } else {
        DeleteCommand deleteCommandForPerson = parseForPersonIndexes(args, preamble);
        if (deleteCommandForPerson != null) {
            return deleteCommandForPerson; <2>
        }
    }

    // ...
}
----


==== Overloading the DeleteCommand constructor

With reference to the previous code snippet the type of `DeleteCommand` returned during the parse is also different.
They differ by the types of the parameters.

<1> A `deleteCommandForTag` which is a `new DeleteCommand(Set<Tag>)` is returned when deleting one or more tags.
<2> A `deleteCommandForPerson` which is a `new DeleteCommand(Index)` or a `new DeleteCommand(ArrayList<Index>)` is returned when deleting one or more persons.

The following code shows the respective object construction of the different types of DeleteCommand.

Depending on the constructor method called, *either* the `targetIndexes` attribute *or* the `targetTags` will be made null,
which will lead on to the next section about command execution.

[source,java]
----
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ...
    private final Index targetIndexes;

    private final Set<Tag> targetTags;

    public DeleteCommand(Set<Tag> targetTags) {
        this.targetIndexes = null;
        this.targetTags = targetTags;
    }

    public DeleteCommand(Index targetIndex) {
        this.targetIndexes = new ArrayList<>();
        targetIndexes.add(targetIndex);
        this.targetTags = null;
    }

    public DeleteCommand(ArrayList<Index> targetIndexes) {
        this.targetIndexes = targetIndexes;
        this.targetTags = null;
    }

    // ...
}
----

==== Logic Execution depending on which attributes are present.

_If_ `targetIndexes` is present/non-null, execute the logic for deleting a person, _else_ execute the logic for deleting a tag.

This trivial implementation is show below. The distinct command execution of the deleting of tags and the
delete of person(s) have been abstracted to apply SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Per method).

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    if (targetTags == null && targetIndexes != null) {
        return executeCommandForPersons();

    } else {
        return executeCommandForTag();
    }
}
----

==== Command Logic

The delete command undergoes a typical command execution in the `Logic` Component. Refer to Figure 3.3.3.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions with the `Model` Component.

Not shown in Figure 4.3.4.1, `listTags` are checked against `listOfExistingTags`, i.e. all tags
to be deleted are checked whether each of them already exist in the address book. If this check fails, an exception is thrown.
The sequence diagram demonstrates a *successful* deletion, hence this aspect of the logic is omitted for clarity.

**Aspect:** Implementation of Delete Tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The existing `delete` command is modified. +
**Pros:** The same command word `delete` is used which is an intuitive way to invoke a deletion of some object (person or tag).  +
**Cons:** The `DeleteCommand` class is no longer responsible for deletion of a person *only* but is now responsible for deleting a tag as well.
Modifying the command via overriding constructors, adding new attributes and modifying the parse may seem too convoluted a solution.
This Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `DeleteCommand` now needs to do two different things.
Also, users who are used to the previous version of the command may not appreciate the new change, especially if it causes new bugs. +
**Alternative 2:** A new command `deletetag` is created. +
**Pros:** The implementation of a new command is simple. This does not involve any major modification of the existing parse and command logic. +
**Cons:** `deletetag t/tag` is not as intuitive in the command line interface especially to new or casual users. Users may try `delete t/tag` out of instinct and we would need to inform or prompt users of the `deletetag` command.

---

**Aspect:** Execution of delete command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** On the `Logic` level, we iterate through an array of tags and invoke a Model method `deleteTag(Tag tag)` on each tag.  +
**Pros:** This maintains consistency with the Model API that deals with objects in singular amounts. _(At the time of coding. See Note below.)_ +
**Cons:** This requires a loop to delete the tags. +
**Alternative 2:** On the `Logic` level, we invoke a method `deleteTags(tagSet)` on a Set<Tag>  and implement `deleteTags(Set<Tag> tagSet)` in the Model component. +
**Pros:** The code will be easier for future contributors to understand. +
**Cons:** This does not maintain consistency of the API.

(**Note:** Pull Request #79 Delete multiple persons, chooses Alternative 2 as its design consideration with `deletePersons(ArrayList<ReadOnlyPerson> targets)` implemented
in the Model Component.)

// end::deletetag[]

// tag::edittag[]
=== Edit Command [Tag] Mechanism

Editing a tag means editing a specified tag (the old tag) in all persons who contain that tag,
as well as editing the tag from the master list of tags in the Address Book.

This is significantly different from editing a person's tag via the `edit` command.
There is a need for this because a user would like to edit a tag for multiple people containing that tag.

To edit a particular tag across multiple contacts, by editing each contact, would be a tedious process, hence, the addition of this feature.

In this section, you will see that the implementation of editing a tag is very similar to deleting a tag.

The existing `edit` command was also modified, to allow `edit` to execute a edit on tags, or a edit on persons,
depending on the parameters provided.

It differs from `delete` tag in terms of executing the respective logic of person or tag.
Instead of checking which attributes of `EditCommand` are present/non-null, a boolean variable determine which command logic to execute


==== Detection of the Edit Type

The concept of using the preamble, as seen in `DeleteCommandParser`, is also used in `EditCommandParser`.

Preamble for

* `edit INDEX ...` (Edit Person) : A *digit* String
* `edit old/TAG new/TAG` (Edit Tag) :  A *blank* String

The implementation of this parse is shown below. Similarly, SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Per method) is applied by
abstracting the distinct parsing between edit a person and editing a tag:

[source,java]
----
public EditCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    //...

    if (preamble.matches("")) {
        return parseForTags(argsMultimap); <1>
    } else if (preamble.matches("\\d+")) {
        return parseForPersonDetails(argsMultimap); <2>
    }

    //...
}
----


==== Overloading the EditCommand constructor

With reference to the previous code snippet the type of `EditCommand` returned during the parse is also different.
The parameter type of the EditCommand is different.

<1> A `new EditCommand(Tag, Tag)` from the method parseForTags(argsMultimap) is returned.
<2> A `new EditCommand(Index, EditPersonDescriptor)` from the method parseForPersonDetails(argsMultimap) is returned.

The following code shows the respective object construction of the different types of EditCommand.

Depending on the constructor method called, the irrelevant attributes will be made null.
The boolean variable `isEditForPerson` is assigned the value `true` when the edit command is for editing a person, and `false` if it is for editing a tag.

[source,java]
----
public class EditCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ...
    private final boolean isEditForPerson;
    private final Index index;
    private final EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor;
    private final Tag oldTag;
    private final Tag newTag;

    public EditCommand(Index index, EditPersonDescriptor editPersonDescriptor) {
        requireNonNull(index);
        requireNonNull(editPersonDescriptor);

        this.isEditForPerson = true;
        this.index = index;
        this.editPersonDescriptor = new EditPersonDescriptor(editPersonDescriptor);
        this.oldTag = null;
        this.newTag = null;
    }

    public EditCommand(Tag oldTag, Tag newTag) {
        requireNonNull(oldTag);
        requireNonNull(newTag);

        this.isEditForPerson = false;
        this.index = null;
        this.editPersonDescriptor = null;
        this.oldTag = oldTag;
        this.newTag = newTag;
    }

    // ...
}
----

==== Logic Execution depending on which attributes are present.

_If_ `isEditForPerson` is present, execute the logic for editing a person, _else_ execute the logic for editing a tag.

This trivial implementation is show below. The distinct command execution of the editing of tags and the
editing of person(s) have been abstracted to apply SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Per method).

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
    if (isEditForPerson) {
        return executeCommandForPerson();
    } else {
        return executeCommandForTag();
    }
}
----

==== Command Logic

The edit command undergoes a typical command execution in the `Logic` Component. Refer to Figure 3.3.3.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions with the `Model` Component.

image::EditCommandForTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 4.4.4.1 : How each tag is edited from the Address Book and each Person's list of tags_


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of Edit Tags.

The design considerations are similar to the to Implementation of Delete Tags. +

Modifying the existing `edit` command was picked over creating a new command `edittag`
// end::edittag[]

// tag::TagColorMap[]
=== Tag Colouring Mechanism
Tag labels appear in various `UI` components: `PersonCard`, `TagListPanel` and `PersonInfoPanel`. +
// tag::you[]
In order for a tag to have the same color across all components, there was a need for the `UI` Components
to keep track of what colors have been used and which color was a tag tied to. +
You will be able to understand how a Singleton class `TagColorMap` was implemented.
// end::you[]

image::ClassDiagramTagColorMap.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.5.1 : The class diagram for TagColorMap_

As a result of this singleton class, coloring tags on initialisation is made extremely easy,
since `TagColorMap` provided `UI` components an easy way to access the color mapping of tags and
color the tags accordingly in the application, from anywhere in the code base.

The following code is common in `PersonCard.java`, `TagListPanel.java`, `PersonInfoPanel.java`
as all the these components require rendering tags, especially in the `initTags` method shown below.

[source,java]
----
private void initTags(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    person.getTags().forEach(tag -> {
            Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
            tagLabel.setStyle("-fx-background-color: " + TagColorMap.getInstance().getTagColor(tag.tagName));
            tags.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
        }
    );
}
----

// tag::you[]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspects:** Implementation Coloring of Tag +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** A singleton class TagColorMap to provide colors, and mapping of tags to colors is used. +
**Pros:** This is easy to implement and easy to access from any UI Component. +
**Cons:** This increases coupling across the code base. Difficult to replace TagColorMap with a stub when doing tests. +
**Alternative 2:** TagColorMap as a class attribute of MainWindow is used and is passed as a parameter to the constructors of relevant UI components.  +
**Pros:** This is a naive method and straightforward to implement. +
**Cons:** This requires a large amount of modification of existing code base of the `UI` component.

---
// end::you[]
// end::TagColorMap[]

// tag::remarkCommand[]
=== Remark Command Mechanism

The remark command allows user to modify the remark of a contact, and it supports adding, editing and deleting remarks. +
It is different from adding the tags using `AddCommand` as you should notice that it is used to store the unique information of the contact. +
We are implementing this `Remark Command` because NUS students see a need to add additional information to their contacts as a reminder to themselves, such as `owesMoney` to someone.


Generally, the implementation of this command is similar to `EditCommand`.

---

These main classes are added to implement this enhancement:

* `Remark`
* `RemarkCommand`
* `RemarkCommandParser`
* ...


These main classes are significantly edited to implement this enhancement:

* `AddressBookParser`
* `PersonListCard`
* `PersonCardHandle`
* `XmlAdaptedPerson`
* `Person`
* `EditCommand`
* `AddCommand`
* ...


[NOTE]
Instead of typing the command `remark`, an alternative would be `rm`. +
The alias is added to the `RemarkCommand Class`. +
The added remark will be displayed on the last line of the person card. +
If a person is newly added to the personList by `AddCommand`, its remark field will be an empty string. +
In the `EditCommand` class, a new attribute `updatedRemark` is added to the person, and it is independent from `editPersonDescriptor`.

==== Implementation of Remark Command

**[Step 1]** _Logic:_ Teach the app to accept `remark` which does nothing

**[Step 2]** _Logic:_ Teach the app to accept `remark` arguments

**[Step 3]** _Ui:_ Add a placeholder for `remark` in `PersonCard`

**[Step 4]** _Model:_ Add `Remark` class

**[Step 5]** _Model:_ Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field

**[Step 6]** _Storage:_ Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class

**[Step 7]** _Ui:_ Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`

**[Step 8]** _Logic:_ Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic

==== Codes and Diagrams
The following diagram shows the high-level sequence diagram of the `RemarkCommand` for you:

image::RemarkCommandHighLevelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2.1 : High-level sequence diagram_

`RemarkCommand` extends `UndoableCommand`, which is an abstract subclass of abstract class command, so the user can also undo the added remark.
The class inheritance diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandClassInheritanceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2.2 : Class Inheritance Diagram_

The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
/*
 * Edits the remark of a person to the address book.
 */
public class RemarkCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    //...
}
----

After `RemarkCommand` is executed, the new data will be saved to the AddressBook. The logic component sequence diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandLogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2.3 : Logic Component Sequence Diagram_

We create a new `Remark` attribute, and the `Person` class is linked to it. Its model component class diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2.4 : Component Class Diagram_

The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
public class Person implements ReadOnlyPerson {
    //...
    private ObjectProperty<Address> address;
    private ObjectProperty<Timetable> timetable;
    private ObjectProperty<Remark> remark;

    // ...
}
----

// tag::you[]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspects:** UI Display of Remark +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** The remark of the specified contact at the end of the personCard is displayed. +
**Pros:** This has the consistent format with other fields in the person card. +
**Cons:** This does not highlight the remark so that the user might hardly notice the additional remark information. +
**Alternative 2:** The Remark is displayed next to the name. +
**Pros:** This would be able to better reminds the user of the added remark information. Also, the font-size is larger that is easier to read. +
**Cons:** This does not have the consistent formatting with other fields in the person card. If the remark is too long, it will be poorly displayed as well.

---

**Aspects:** The command nature of Remark +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** A RemarkCommand to add remarks to a contact is used. +
**Pros:** It is not the compulsory field when a person is added as most people do not add remarks to a newly added contact. +
**Cons:** It is an extra command for the user to remember. +
**Alternative 2:** AddCommand and EditCommand are used for adding and editing of the remark. +
**Pros:** The command lines are more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** The remark is perceived as a compulsory field of personal information for that contact, but this is not true.
// end::you[]
// end::remarkCommand[]


// tag::photoCommand[]
=== Photo Command Mechanism
// tag::you[]
The photo command allows users to assign photos to their contacts, and it also supports adding, editing and deleting photos as the remark command.
You will be able to understand how it accepts the absolute path in the user's computer and copies the original photo to the default folder of the file.
We are implementing this `PhotoCommand` as NUS students may want to keep themselves reminded of how their contacts look like.
// end::you[]

---

These classes are added to implement this enhancement:

* `PhotoPath`
* `PhotoCommand`
* `PhotoCommandParser`
* `PhotoPathNotFoundException`
* `DuplicationPhotoPathException`
* `UniquePhotoPathList`
* `XmlAdaptedPhotoPath`
* ...

These classes are edited to implement this enhancement:

* `AddressBook`
* `FileUtil`
* `AddCommand`
* `EditCommand`
* `PersonInfoPanel`
* `XmlAdaptedPerson`
* `Person`
* ...

---


[NOTE]
Instead of typing the command `photo`, an alternative would be `ph`. +
The alias is added to the `PhotoCommand` Class. +
The added photo will be displayed on the `PersonInfoPanel`. +
If a `photoPath` is newly added to the photoList by `PhotoCommand`, it will be saved to the default folder and linked to the specified contact. +
If a `photoPath` is removed from one contact, the link between the photo and the contact will be removed, but the photo file
are still kept inside the folder until the next time the user starts the application in case the user wants to undo the command. +
Up to now, the photo command hasn't supported the `RedoCommand`.

==== Implementation of Photo Command

**[Step 1]** _Logic:_ Create the `photoCommandParser` class to parse the input.

**[Step 2]** _Logic:_ Teach the app to accept `photoPath` arguments

**[Step 3]** _Ui:_ Add a Shape `Circle` for displaying the photo in `personInfoPanel`

**[Step 4]** _Model:_ Add `PhotoPath` class

**[Step 5]** _Model:_ Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `photoPath` field

**[Step 6]** _Storage:_ Add the `photoPath` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class

**[Step 7]** _Ui:_ Connect the `photoPath` field to `PersonInfoPanel` class, display the contact photo

**[Step 8]** _Logic:_ Implement `PhotoCommand#execute()` logic

**[Step 9]** _Commons:_ Implement related methods in `FileUtil`

**[Step 10]** _Models:_ Implement how to initialize the `UniquePhotoPathList` and delete unused photo in `AddressBook` class


==== Codes and Diagrams

The interactions between multiple objects are complicated, so the following diagram shows the simplified high-level sequence diagram for you:

image::PhotoCommand_highLevelSequenceDiagrams.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.2.1 : High-level Sequence Diagram_


For the logic component part, the `PhotoCommandParser` is created by the `AddressBookParser`, and the `PhotoCommand` is created by the `PhotoCommandParser`.
The logic component class diagram is shown below:

image::PhotoCommand_logicComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.2.2 : Logic Component Class Diagram_

Also, the `PhotoCommand` class inherits from the `UndoableCommand` class.
The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Edits the photo path of the specified person.
 */
public class PhotoCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    //...
}
----

As shown in Figure 4.7.2.3, the `AddressBook` consists of one `UniqueTagList`, one `UniquePersonList`, and one `UniquePhotoPathList`.
The `UniquePhotoPathList` acts as a container for `PhotoPath` objects.

image::PhotoCommand_modelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.2.3 : Model Component Class Diagram_

We create a new `PhotoPath` attribute, and the `Person` class is linked to it.

The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Represents the path of a person's photo in the address book.
 */
public class PhotoPath {

    public static final String FILE_SAVED_PARENT_PATH = "src/main/resources/images/contactPhotos/";
    public static final String MESSAGE_APP_PHOTOPATH_CONSTRAINTS =
            "The app photo path should be a string starting with '"
                    + FILE_SAVED_PARENT_PATH
                    + "', following by the file name with a valid extension, like'photo.jpg'.\n"
                    + "The valid extensions are 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif' or 'bmp'.";

    public final String value;

    //...
}
----

// tag::you[]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspects:** The way the contact photo saved in users' computers is retrieved. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users are required to specify the absolute path of the photo. +
**Pros:** This might be inconvenient as users need additional steps to get the absolute file of the photo. +
**Cons:** The image file is specified accurately by using the command line. +
**Alternative 2:** Users are provided a pop-up window to choose the photo. +
**Pros:** It is more convenient for the user to choose the file. +
**Cons:** This becomes no more a command-line input in this command-line application.
// end::you[]
// end::photoCommand[]

// tag::birthday[]
=== Birthday Attribute

Users are able to store birthdays by inputting in the format of DDMMYYYY when adding a person. You will be able to understand how Birthday is being stored and parsed over.
This allows the user to get a list of people having the same birthday month.

In general, the ability to store a person's birthday was implemented via an _augmentation_ of the component of `Person`.

==== Representation of Birthdays

Storing of birthdays is facilitated by an immutable `Birthday` object, which is a component of `Person`.

The following are the main classes edited to implement this:

* AddCommand
* AddCommandParser
* EditCommand
* EditCommandParser
* Person
* PersonListCard, PersonCardHandle
* XmlAdaptedPerson


The following UML diagram represents the implementation of the classes in the Model component.

image::BirthdayModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.8.1.1 : UML diagram for updated Model with Birthday_

==== Validation of Birthdays
After the birthday is input, it will be checked if the date is valid.
The number of digits input will be checked first.
Then the year would be checked from the 20th century until now.
Range of day input will then be checked according to month.

[source,java]
----
public static boolean isValidBirthday(String test) {

    if (test.matches(BIRTHDAY_VALIDATION_REGEX)) {
        try {
            DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT);
            df.setLenient(false);
            df.parse(test);
            return true;
        } catch (ParseException pe) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Representation of birthdays +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The birthday of the specified contact is displayed as string of numbers with `/` separating the day, month and year. +
**Pros:** This is easy to implement as there is no need to alter the input. +
**Cons:** It is difficult to recognise the date from the number displayed. +
**Alternative 2:** The birthday is in the format of 25 Dec 1997. +
**Pros:** It is simple and easy to understand. +
**Cons:** It requires extra methods to change the format displayed.
// end::birthday[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Command [Filter] Mechanism

Finding a person by filters means that users will be able to find a person using different fields of information. Currently, UniFy supports users to find a person by name, phone, email, address, tags and birthday month. This allows users to have more flexibility in the way they search for their contacts. +
Only persons who match all keywords in all fields will be returned. You will be able to understand how the result of the find command is determined.

In general, the ability to find persons by filters was implemented by modifying the existing `find` command.

The modification involves:

* Parsing of user input in the FindCommandParser
* Searching of different fields for the person list in the FindCommand

==== Parsing of user input

The input will be tokenized against the `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/` and `b/` prefixes which are for name, phone, email, address, tags and birthday month respectively. This can be done by the `ArgumentTokenizer` class. +
The user input will be parsed as an ArrayList with prefixes and keywords separated. If the index of `n/` is 1, the keywords for the name field will be at the index of 2 in the ArrayList. +

The implementation of this parse is shown below:

[source,java]
----
if (argsMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME).isPresent()) {
    nameList = argsMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME).get();
    predicate.add(PREFIX_NAME.getPrefix());
    predicate.add(nameList);
}
----

Since the field of `b/` only takes in birthday month, a small check is implemented to determine the validity of the keyword input. The birthday month is checked to only contain integer and be within the range of 1 to 12.

The implementation of this check is shown below:

[source,java]
----
// checks if birthday month contains non-integers, and returns "Keyword input must be in integer."
if (!birthdayList.matches("[0-9]+")) {
    throw new ParseException(FindCommand.MESSAGE_BIRTHDAYKEYWORD_NONNUMBER);

// checks if birthday month in out of bound, and returns "Month %1$s does not exist."
} else if (Integer.parseInt(birthdayList.trim()) > 12 || Integer.parseInt(birthdayList.trim()) < 1) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(FindCommand.MESSAGE_BIRTHDAYKEYWORD_NONEXIST, birthdayList.trim()));

} else if (birthdayList.trim().length() == 1) {
    throw new ParseException(String.format(FindCommand.MESSAGE_BIRTHDAYKEYWORD_INVALID, birthdayList.trim()));
}
----

==== Searching of Persons using several fields of information

The search is done using the following steps.

. The code searches persons matching the keyword in the name field, followed by the rest of the fields.
. The persons matching the keyword will be added into a HashMap<String, Integer> that stores the name of the person and the number of times the person matches the keywords.
. The persons are then added to a new ArrayList if the number of times the person matches the keywords equals to the number of keywords input.
. The ArrayList containing names of persons, having information that matches all keywords in respective fields, will be updated in the filtered list.
. The find result displayed to users.

The implementation of person's phone being searched is shown below:
[source,java]
----
public ArrayList<String> findPersonsWithPhone(String phone) {
    // Get the list of persons in UniFy
    ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> personList = model.getAddressBook().getPersonList();

    String[] phoneKeyword = phone.split(" ");

    // Keeping track of the number of keywords input in total
    count += phoneKeyword.length;

    ArrayList<String> phoneList = new ArrayList<>();

    for (ReadOnlyPerson person : personList) {
        for (String keyword : phoneKeyword) {
            String phones = person.getPhone().toString();

            // keyword is a subset of phones (do not have to match fully)
            if (phones.contains(keyword)) {
                phoneList.add(person.getName().toString());
            }
        }
    }
    return phoneList;
}
----

The implementation of tracking the number of times a person being matched is shown below:
[source, java]
----
// if phone prefix is input
if (predicates.equals(PREFIX_PHONE.getPrefix())) {

    // Result from the code above
    ArrayList<String> personsWithPhone = findPersonsWithPhone(predicate.get(i + 1));

    for (int j = 0; j < personsWithPhone.size(); j++) {

        // if it is the first time this person is being searched, add the person in with time of matches = 1
        if (!predicateMap.containsKey(personsWithPhone.get(j))) {
            predicateMap.put(personsWithPhone.get(j), 1);
            predicateList.add(personsWithPhone.get(j));

        // if the person is searched before, increase the time of matches by 1
        } else {
            predicateMap.put(personsWithPhone.get(j), predicateMap.remove(personsWithPhone.get(j)) + 1);
        }
    }
}
----

==== Command Logic

The following is the logic component class diagram for `FindCommand`

image::FindCommandLogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.9.3.1 : FindCommand Logic Component Class Diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of find command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only the persons matching all keywords are returned. +
**Pros:** This aligns with the purpose of implementing this enhancement to allow users to refine and limit their search by inputting more keywords in different fields. +
**Cons:** It is harder to implement as we need to keep track of how many times a person is being matched. +
**Alternative 2:** All persons matching one or more keywords are returned. +
**Pros:** It is simple to implement. +
**Cons:** By typing more keywords in different fields, more persons matching one of the keywords will be returned which defeats the purpose of having this enhancement.
// end::find[]

// tag::suggest[]
=== Suggest Command Mechanism

This feature will conduct spelling check if the command input does not match any of the existing commands. It will prompt an error message suggesting the correct spelling of the command word. You will be able to understand how the code determines the correct spelling. +
This is implemented because there is many commands to remember in UniFy and we suspect users might have typos during their usage.

In general, the ability of this command was implemented by adding a SuggestCommand class.

==== Implementation of Suggest Command

`SuggestCommand` class calls the `UniqueCommandList` class to determine the possible correct spellings and to retrieve the list of command words existing in the address book.

We have identified a few spelling mistakes that our users might make.

* Two alphabets swapping positions
* One extra alphabet added
* One alphabet lacking
* One alphabet mistyped

The implementation of the determination of possible spellings is shown below:
[source, java]
----
public static TreeSet<String> getPossibleCommandList(String command) {
    possibleCommandList = new TreeSet<>();

    // Swapping i with i+1
    for (int i = 1; i < command.length() - 1; i++) {
        possibleCommandList.add(command.substring(0, i) + command.charAt(i + 1) + command.charAt(i) + command.substring(i + 2));
    }

    // deleting one char, skipping i
    for (int i = 0; i < command.length(); i++) {
        possibleCommandList.add(command.substring(0, i) + command.substring(i + 1));
    }

    // inserting one char
    for (int i = 0; i < command.length() + 1; i++) {
        for (char j = 'a'; j <= 'z'; j++) {
            possibleCommandList.add(command.substring(0, i) + j + command.substring(i));

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of suggest command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** An error message suggesting the correct spelling for the command word is returned. +
**Pros:** This is easier to implement without modification of other command classes. +
**Cons:** This would still require the user to correct his spelling error by himself. +
**Alternative 2:** The suggested command is conducted then prompt to ask if the user is intending to conduct such an action. +
**Pros:** This does not require the user to retype to correct his spelling error. +
**Cons:** This is harder to implement and if the user do not intent to conduct the suggested command action, the user has to do an extra step to undo the command, which might be inconvenient.
// end::suggest[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

// tag::you[]
* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Problems detected that does not affect the usage of app, but requires to continue with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
// end::you[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

You can see <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

You can see <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Building Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
