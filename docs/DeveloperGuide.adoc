== Introduction

Welcome to UniFy !

UniFy is a command-line application which provides a convenient way to store students' contact information. It is customised for NUS students, allowing them to efficiently manage their contact lists. This developer guide provides information that helps you to get started as a UniFy contributor, and aids you even if you are an experienced contributor.
The developer guide consists of the following sections.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
This app will only work with later versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Please do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up UniFy in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

Our UniFy project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, then `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance automatically as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

You would have to set up `Travis` to perform CI for your fork. You can check <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up `AppVeyor` as a second CI (check <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both `Travis` and `AppVeyor` ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you can get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.


== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. A quick overview of each component is given below.

[TIP]
You can find the `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this developer guide in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

==== Main
`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

==== Commons
link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. These classes can be found in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package. The following two classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events.
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

==== Four main components
The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The User Interface (UI) of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes command.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (_Fig 3.1.2_) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This shows you how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

---
The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, and `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is designed to suit the needs of students who might accidentally execute a undesired command. It is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3.3.1_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. The technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

When the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2a : The most recent undoable command is pushed into the undoStack_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2b : More commands are added into the undoStack_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2c : The command on the top will be popped and pushed into the redoStack_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : The sequence diagram for the undo function_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2d : When a new command is pushed into undoStack, the redoStack is purged_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2e : The list command is not added to the undoStack_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : Activity diagram when a new command is executed_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` will not know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()` to gain the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Timetables Attribute

Users are able to store timetables by supplying a shortened NUSMods url when adding a person. This need is especially crucial for NUS students who require friends' timetables in order to find out a time to meet up.

==== Retrieval of Lesson Information

NUSMods urls are in the format of `.../timetable/ACAD_YEAR/SEM?MODULE_CODE[LESSON_TYPE]=LESSON_NO&...`  We use `TimetableParserUtil : expandUrl` to get an expanded url from shortened URL provided, then parse the expanded url accordingly to obtain lesson data.
Lessons for each module are stored in `ModuleInfoFromUrl`, which is then represented in `TimetableInfoFromUrl`.

https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods-api[NUSMods API] is used to retrieve data related to lessons parsed from urls. JSON objects representing each module is retrieved and
cast to a `Map` using http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library]. Lesson data is then retrieved as a list of `Lesson` objects.

[source,java]
----
// read JSON as map
Map<String, Object> mappedJson = mapper.readValue(url, HashMap.class);
// retrieve lesson data
ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lessonInfo = mappedJson.get("Timetable");

ArrayList<Lesson> lessons = new ArrayList<>();
for (HashMap<String, String> lesson : lessonInfo) {
    Lesson lessonToAdd = new Lesson(...);
    lessons.add(lessonToAdd);
}
----

`TimetableParserUtil` in `commons.util.timetable` contains all utility methods for parsing of NUSMods urls and conversion between terms parsed from urls and terms used in NUSMods API.

==== Representation of Timetables

Storing of timetables is facilitated by an immutable `Timetable` object, which is a component of `Person`. The information regarding the timings of each lesson is stored in a single `TimetableInfo` object within `Timetable`.
More specific information for a person's lessons is abstracted further as follows:

* Information for odd/even weeks are stored by two `TimetableWeek` objects within `TimetableInfo`
* Each day of the timetable (Monday to Friday) is represented by five `TimetableDay` objects in `TimetableWeek`
* To represent each timeslot in `TimetableDay`, a `TimetableSlot` class is used to represent a 30 minute interval. 32 instances of `TimetableSlot` are used to represent a full day from 0800 to 0000

The following UML diagram represents the implementation of the classes.

image::TimetableClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Timetable class diagram (XYZComponent refers to all other components that `Person` is composed of, the class diagram is not complete)_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Representation of timetables +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Abstraction of timetable grid using classes for weeks/days/slots +
**Pros:** Easily extendable to include new functionality e.g. lessons that occur in each slot +
**Cons:** Requires many method call chains to update and query timetable, might not be intuitive for new programmers. Hard to iterate through entire timetable +
**Alternative 2:** Using a 3D array to represent the entire timetable +
**Pros:** Simple and easy to understand,  easy to iterate through +
**Cons:** Does not follow OOP concepts, cannot be extended to implement new functionalities. +
**Alternative 3:** Storing individual lesson timings and information. +
**Pros:** Building the timetable is not required +
**Cons:** Inefficient queries if a timing has a lesson, need to iterate through every lesson stored.

---

**Aspect:** Shortened URLs versus full-length URLs +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only accept short URLs +
**Pros:** No need to deal with multiple types of URL +
**Cons:** Less user friendly as users need to supply specific type of URL +
**Alternative 2:** Accept both shortened and full-length NUSMods URLs +
**Pros:** More user friendly as any type of NUSMods URL is accepted +
**Cons:** Much harder to detect malformed URL as parsing data does not detect errors in lesson tokens in URL. Shortened URL gives 403 response on bad URL.

=== Delete Tag Mechanism

To delete a tag means to delete a specified tag in all persons who contain that tag, as well as in the master list of tags in the Address Book.
This is significantly different from deleting a tag for a person via the `edit` command.
There is a need for this because a user would like to delete a tag that is no longer relevant or is outdated, instead of going editing those with the same tags one by one.
To delete a particular tag across multiple contacts would be a tedious process, hence, the addition of this feature.

In general, the ability to delete a tag was implemented via an _augmentation_ of the existing `delete` command.

This augmentation is achieved via

* detection of the type of deletion in the DeleteCommandParser
* overloading the DeleteCommand constructor
* executing the respective logic based on which attributes are present/non-null.

==== Detection of the Deletion Type

The current `delete` command (for a person) is in the format `delete INDEX`. Deleting a tag is in the format `delete t/TAG`.
The same `delete` command is used but the parameters in the command line are different.

The two types of commands are distinguished by the `preamble` of the parameter arguments after the word `delete`, when tokenized against the `/t` prefix for tags.

The preamble for `delete "INDEX"` is a *digit* while the preamble for `delete" "t/TAG` is a *space*.
The implementation of this parse is shown below:


[source,java]
----
public DeleteCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_TAG);
    String preamble = argMultimap.getPreamble();

    if (preamble.equals("")) {
        // parsing of tags into a Set<Tag> tagList
        return new DeleteCommand(tagList); # <1>

    } else if (preamble.matches("-?\\d+")) {
        // parsing of the index
        return new DeleteCommand(index); # <2>
    }
    // ...
}
----


==== Overloading the DeleteCommand constructor

With reference to the previous code snippet the type of `DeleteCommand` returned during the parse are also different.

<1> a `new DeleteCommand(tagList)` is returned when deleting one or more tags.
<2> a `new DeleteCommand(index)` is returned when deleting a person.

The following code shows the respective object construction of both types of DeleteCommand.


Depending on the constructor method called, *either* the `targetIndex` attribute *or* the `targetTags` will be made null.
Which will lead on to the next section about command execution.

[source,java]
----
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    // ...
    private final Index targetIndex;

    private final Set<Tag> targetTags;

    public DeleteCommand(Index targetIndex) {
        this.targetIndex = targetIndex;
        this.targetTags = null;
    }

    public DeleteCommand(Set<Tag> targetTags) {
        this.targetTags = targetTags;
        this.targetIndex = null;
    }
    // ...
}
----



==== Logic Execution depending on which attributes are present.

_If_ `targetIndex` is present, execute the logic for deleting a person, _else_ execute the logic for deleting a tag.

This trivial implementation is show below.

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {

    if (targetTags == null && targetIndex != null) {
        // command logic for deletion for a person
    } else {
        // command logic for deletion for a tag
    }
    // ...
}
----

==== Command Logic

The following sequence diagrams show how the delete operation for tags work.

Not shown in Figure 4.3.2, `listTags` are checked against `listOfExistingTags`, i.e. all tags
to be deleted are checked whether each of them already exist in the address book. If this check fails, an exception is thrown.
The sequence diagram demonstrates a *successful* deletion, hence this aspect of the logic is omitted for clarity.

image::DeleteCommandForTagSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2 : The tags parsed are put into an ArrayList and iterated through for deletion_

image::DeleteCommandForTagSequenceDiagram3.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.3 : How each tag is removed from the Address Book and each Person's list of tags_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of Delete Tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Augment the existing delete command +
**Pros:** The same command word `delete` is used which is an intuitive way to invoke a deletion of some object (person or tag).  +
**Cons:** The `DeleteCommand` class is no longer responsible for deletion of a person *only*
but is now responsible for deleting a tag as well.
Augmenting the command via overriding constructors, adding new attributes and modifying the parse may seem too convoluted a solution. This Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `DeleteCommand` now needs to do two different things. Users who are used to the previous version of the command may not appreciate the new change also. +
**Alternative 2:** Just create a new command `deletetag` +
**Pros:** Simple implementation of a new command. Does not involve any major modification of existing parse and command logic +
**Cons:** `deletetag t/tag` is not as intuitive a command line especially to new or casual users.
Users may try `delete t/tag` out of instinct and we would need to inform or prompt users of the `deletetag` command.

---

**Aspect:** How delete command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** On the `Logic` level, iterate through an array of tags and invoke a Model method `deleteTag(Tag tag)` on each tag.  +
**Pros:** Maintain consistency with the Model API that deals with objects in singular amounts. +
**Cons:** Requires a loop to delete the tags. +
**Alternative 2:** On the `Logic` level, invoke a method `deleteTags(tagSet)` on a Set<Tag>. Implement `deleteTags(Set<Tag> tagSet)` in the Model component. +
**Pros:** The code will be easier for future contributors to understand. +
**Cons:** Does not maintain consistency of the API

---

=== Remark Command Mechanism

The remark command allows user to modify the remark of a contact, and it supports adding, editing and deleting remarks.
It is different from adding the tags using `AddCommand` as it is used to store unique information of contact.
We are implementing this `Remark Command` because NUS students see a need to add additional information to their contacts as a reminder to themselves, such as `owesMoney` to someone.


Generally, the implementation of this command is similar to `EditCommand`.

---

These main classes are added to implement this enhancement:

* Remark
* RemarkCommand
* RemarkCommandParser

---

These main classes are significantly edited to implement this enhancement:

* AddressBookParser
* PersonListCard, PersonCardHandle
* XmlAdaptedPerson
* Person
* EditCommand
* AddCommand

[NOTE]
Instead of typing the command `remark`, an alternative would be `rm`.
The alias is added to the `RemarkCommand Class`.
The added remark will be displayed on the last line of the person card.
If a person is newly added to the personList by `AddCommand` without a remark, its remark field will be an empty string.
In the `EditCommand` class, a new attribute `updatedRemark` is added to the person, and it is independent from `editPersonDescriptor`.

==== Implementation of Remark Command

**[Step 1]** _Logic:_ Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing

**[Step 2]** _Logic:_ Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments

**[Step 3]** _Ui:_ Add a placeholder for remark in PersonCard

**[Step 4]** _Model:_ Add Remark class

**[Step 5]** _Model:_ Modify ReadOnlyPerson to support a Remark field

**[Step 6]** _Storage:_ Add Remark field to XmlAdaptedPerson class

**[Step 7]** _Ui:_ Connect Remark field to PersonCard

**[Step 8]** _Logic:_ Implement RemarkCommand#execute() logic

==== Codes and Diagrams
The following diagram shows the high-level sequence diagram of the remark command:

image::RemarkCommandHighLevelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : High-level sequence diagram_

The RemarkCommand extends Undoable Command, which is an abstract subclass of abstract class Command, so the user can also undo the added remark.
The class inheritance diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandClassInheritanceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.2 : Class Inheritance Diagram_

The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
/*
 * Edits the remark of a person to the address book.
 */
public class RemarkCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    //...
}
----

After the remark command is executed, the new data will be saved to the AddressBook. The logic component sequence diagram is shown below:

A person class is linked to a new remark attribute. Its model component class diagram is shown below:

image::RemarkCommandComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.4 : Component Class Diagram_

The implementation is shown below.

[source,java]
----
public class Person implements ReadOnlyPerson {
    //...
    private ObjectProperty<Address> address;
    private ObjectProperty<Timetable> timetable;
    private ObjectProperty<Remark> remark;
    // ...
----


==== Design Considerations

**Aspects:** UI Display of Remark +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Display the remark of the specified contact at the end of the personCard. +
**Pros:** It has the consistent format with other fields in the person card. +
**Cons:** It does not highlight the remark so that the user will hardly notice the additional remark information. +
**Alternative 2:** Display the Remark next to the name. +
**Pros:** Placing the remark in this prominent place will better remind the user of the added remark.
Also, the font-size is larger that is easier to read. +
**Cons:** It does not have the consistent formatting with other fields in the person card.
If the remark is too long, it will be poorly displayed as well.

**Aspects:** The command nature of Remark +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Use a remark command to add remarks. +
**Pros:** It is not a field when a person is added as most people do not add remarks to a newly added contact. +
**Cons:** It is an extra command for the user to remember. +
**Alternative 2:** Use AddCommand and EditCommand for the adding and editing of remark. +
**Pros:** The command lines are more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** Remark will be perceived as a field of personal information for that contact, which is not true.

=== Birthday Attribute

User are able to store birthdays by inputting in the format of DDMMYYYY when adding a person.
This allows the user to get a list of people having the same birthday month.

In general, the ability to store a person's birthday was implemented via an _augmentation_ of the component of `Person`.

==== Representation of Birthdays

Storing of birthdays is facilitated by an immutable `Birthday` object, which is a component of `Person`.

The following are the main classes edited to implement this:

* AddCommand
* AddCommandParser
* EditCommand
* EditCommandParser
* Person
* PersonListCard, PersonCardHandle
* XmlAdaptedPerson


The following UML diagram represents the implementation of the classes in the Model component.

image::BirthdayModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Validation of Birthdays
After the birthday is inputted, it will be checked if the date is valid.
The number of digits inputted will be checked first.
Then the year would be checked from the 20th century until now.
Range of day inputted will then be checked according to month.

[source,java]
----
public static boolean isValidBirthday(String test) {

    if (test.matches(BIRTHDAY_VALIDATION_REGEX)) {
        try {
            DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT);
            df.setLenient(false);
            df.parse(test);
            return true;
        } catch (ParseException pe) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
----

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Representation of birthdays +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display the birthday of the specified contact at the end of the personCard. +
**Pros:** It has the consistent format with other fields in the person card. +
**Cons:** It is difficult to recognise the number displayed is birthday. +
**Alternative 2:** Display the birthday with "Birthday:" in front. +
**Pros:** Simple and easy to understand. +
**Cons:** Inconsistent with the format in person card.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
