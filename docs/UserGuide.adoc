== Introduction

//tag::intro[]
Thank you for downloading **UniFy**! We're glad that you've chosen us to help you manage your hectic university life.

**UniFy** is a personal assistant to your everyday life in NUS. It helps you maintain your numerous groups,
tells you when your friends are free for lunch, and finds common time for project meetings. It even helps you find directions to
wherever your friends might be!

We know that time is precious for university students, so we made **UniFy** as simple to use as possible. You only need commands
to use **UniFy**, no more searching for hidden buttons or navigating unfamiliar pages!

Excited? Let's get started!
// end::intro[]

== Quick Start

.  Make sure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `UniFy.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for UniFy.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

_Figure 2.2 : UniFy's Interface Dark Theme_
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 m/A0134232H tt/http://modsn.us/etYEX` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`undo`* : undo the previous command
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Now you can explore the rest of UniFy! Refer to the link:#commands[Commands] section below for details of each command.

== Commands

*Command Format*

In this User Guide and in the message box in UniFy, you can see how to type a command by
referring to the Command Format provided for you. +

Understanding the Command Format is easy! Let us explain:

* Commands always start with a command word.
** Example: `add`, `delete`, `clear`, `edit`
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the last generated listing of people.
** `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* e.g.: 1, 2, 3, ...
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are *parameters* you have to give to the command. Each *parameter* is assigned and preceded by a *prefix*: a letter followed by a `/` +
** Example: `add n/*NAME*` +
   `NAME` is a *parameter* you have to give to the `add` command, assigned to the `n/` *prefix* +
   If the *parameter* you want to provide is John Doe, the command will be `add n/*John Doe*`.
* Items in square brackets are optional
** Example: `add n/NAME *[t/TAG]*` +
   You can use the `add` command as `add n/John Doe t/friend` or as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** Example: `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Items can be in any order
** If the Command Format specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Commands have alternative keywords than can be used in place of them.
** Example: You can type `wipe` or `c` instead of `clear` to execute the same command.

[NOTE]
You can view a summary of all commands <<Command Summary (v1.5), here>>,
and a table of all alternative keywords for commands <<Command Alternatives Reference Table, here>>
