=== Enhancement Added: PhotoCommand

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=photoCommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

PhotoCommand is useful as it can remind the user of what his contacts look like.
Users can easily assign photos to their contacts by specifying the unique photo path in their computers.
Also, the display picture of a contact can be easily changed or deleted by the PhotoCommand.

==== Implementation

(Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B1/main/pull/96[#96], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B1/main/pull/150[#150])

=== Enhancement Added: RemarkCommand

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remarkCommand]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
Existing tags are too short for the user to put down the noteworthy thing of a contact,
and the remark for a person are more descriptive and unique so that you can always look back on.
The remark command is designed to be an undoable command, and a new attribute named 'Remark' is
added to the 'Person' class. The remark of a person will be displayed in the person information panel
if the user key in the select command.

=== FisheryApp

Build a software application for LSM4255 (Methods in Mathematical Biology) class in a team.
This application allows students to participate in a fisheries management game to demonstrate the concepts of resource use,
co-operation, and the tragedy of the commons.

=== Algorithm Design Project

Analyze the application of Game theory and Nash-equilibrium for a dynamic multiplayer competition.
Design and implement the basic algorithm for evaluating the value of choices and providing the theoretically
best strategy in the competition. Write the basic source code for this mathematical tool for “iyingdi” website and its mobile app.
