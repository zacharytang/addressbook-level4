== Project: UniFy
UniFy is a desktop Address Book application for University students, particularly those from NUS (National University of Singapore).

The user is able to manage the many people he meets in University, keep track of his friends' Birthdays, view his friend’s timetables, and much more.
Most of the user interactions are via CLI, while there exists a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has
about 6kLoC.

The source code is based on the  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4] project created by SE-EDU initiative.

=== Enhancement Added: Timetable Features

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

NUS students are the target audience of our application, and most planning of events or group meetings require the
usage of an individual's timetables. By implementing the storage of timetables and viewing of combined timetables, users will be
able to easily see when common free times between groups of people are.
