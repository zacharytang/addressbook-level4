== Purpose

This project portfolio documents the software experience I have in the module CS2103/T (Software Engineering).

A section titled 'Documentation Contributions (For CS2101 Use)' contains *additional*
documentation contribution I would like the evaluators in CS2101 (Effective Communication for Computing Professionals) to
take additional note of.
It is *not* for CS2103/T use.

== Project: UniFy
UniFy is a desktop Address Book application for University students, particularly those from NUS (National University of Singapore).

The user is able to manage the many people he meets in University, keep track of his friends' Birthdays, view his friendâ€™s timetables, and much more.
Most of the user interactions are via Command Line Interface, while there exists a Graphical User Interface created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has
about 8kLoC.

The source code is based on the https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4] project created by SE-EDU initiative.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/nbriannl.md[Functional code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Delete Tag

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Deleting a common tag present in multiple contact is tedious, therefore being able to delete a common tag is seen
as an essential feature by a busy University student seeking efficiency.

For example, a University Student, who wants to delete an irrelevant tag (such as 'ProjectGroupMate', when a project is completed),
would want to delete the tag from every contact containing that tag. It would be very inefficient for him
to find all his contacts with that tag, and edit each and every contact with a new set of tags, which excludes the
tag to be deleted.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=deletetag]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Edit Tag

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=edittag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Editing a tag would be a common task a University Student would face.

For example, he may have a clique of friends tagged as a particular module (e.g. CS2010). When all
his friends follow him to another module (e.g. CS3230), he would like to edit all his contacts' 'CS2010'
tag to 'CS3230'. He could edit each and every contact with a new set of tags, including the renamed tag, but it
would be extremely inefficient. Hence, this feature would be convenient and essential for the application.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=edittag]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: GMaps Command To Find Location and Show Directions

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=gmaps]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The target user, the NUS university student, would find himself wanting to meet his friends, either for leisure
or for group projects. If the meet up location is at the house of one of his friends, he would be able to use the application
to easily search for the location since he may have stored the friend's address in the application.

Furthermore, if he is at some location, for example, at school, and would like to find the directions to his friend's house,
he is able to quickly type a command to get directions to his friend's house from his location.

=== Enhancement Added: Tag Bar

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tagbar]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Being able to see all tags that exist in the address book has many benefits to the User Experience. +

It is a useful overview of all the distinct groups of people he may want to he know he has in University, be it friends,
classmates or teaching staff. +

Moreover, users would be able to refer to the bar of tags to easily type in other commands in the application
(for example, finding contacts by tag, deleting and tag or editing a tag).
It is a quick overview to all the tags that are present in UniFy, as well as which tags
are present in the address book, but unused by any contact.

=== Enhancement Added: Themes In UniFy and Theme Command in UniFy

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=theme]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The 2 themes and the Theme Command adds on to the User Experience by providing variety to the user interface.

This enhancement lays on the groundwork for future CSS stylesheets to be added in the application.

=== Enhancements Proposed: Location Related Commands
